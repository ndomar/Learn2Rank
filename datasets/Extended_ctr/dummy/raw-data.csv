1,"the metabolic world of escherichia coli is not small",42,"The metabolic world of Escherichia coli is not small","To elucidate the organizational and evolutionary principles of the metabolism of living organisms, recent studies have addressed the graph-theoretic analysis of large biochemical networks responsible for the synthesis and degradation of cellular building blocks [Jeong, H., Tombor, B., Albert, R., Oltvai, Z. N. \& Barab\{\'a\}si, A. L. (2000) Nature 407, 651-654; Wagner, A. \& Fell, D. A. (2001) Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B 268, 1803-1810; and Ma, H.-W. \& Zeng, A.-P. (2003) Bioinformatics 19, 270-277]. In such studies, the global properties of the network are computed by considering enzymatic reactions as links between metabolites. However, the pathways computed in this manner do not conserve their structural moieties and therefore do not correspond to biochemical pathways on the traditional metabolic map. In this work, we reassessed earlier results by digitizing carbon atomic traces in metabolic reactions annotated for Escherichia coli. Our analysis revealed that the average path length of its metabolism is much longer than previously thought and that the metabolic world of this organism is not small in terms of biosynthesis and degradation."
2,"reverse engineering of biological complexity",43,"Reverse Engineering of Biological Complexity","Advanced technologies and biology have extremely different physical implementations, but they are far more alike in systems-level organization than is widely appreciated. {C}onvergent evolution in both domains produces modular architectures that are composed of elaborate hierarchies of protocols and layers of feedback regulation, are driven by demand for robustness to uncertain environments, and use often imprecise components. {T}his complexity may be largely hidden in idealized laboratory settings and in normal operation, becoming conspicuous only when contributing to rare cascading failures. {T}hese puzzling and paradoxical features are neither accidental nor artificial, but derive from a deep and necessary interplay between complexity and robustness, modularity, feedback, and fragility. {T}his review describes insights from engineering theory and practice that can shed some light on biological complexity."
3,"exploring complex networks",44,"Exploring complex networks","The study of networks pervades all of science, from neurobiology to statistical physics. {T}he most basic issues are structural: how does one characterize the wiring diagram of a food web or the {I}nternet or the metabolic network of the bacterium {E}scherichia coli? {A}re there any unifying principles underlying their topology? {F}rom the perspective of nonlinear dynamics, we would also like to understand how an enormous network of interacting dynamical systems-be they neurons, power stations or lasers-will behave collectively, given their individual dynamics and coupling architecture. {R}esearchers are only now beginning to unravel the structure and dynamics of complex networks."
4,"comparative assessment of largescale data sets of proteinprotein interactions",46,"Comparative assessment of large-scale data sets of protein-protein interactions.","Comprehensive protein protein interaction maps promise to reveal many aspects of the complex regulatory network underlying cellular function. Recently, large-scale approaches have predicted many new protein interactions in yeast. To measure their accuracy and potential as well as to identify biases, strengths and weaknesses, we compare the methods with each other and with a reference set of previously reported protein interactions."
5,"navigation in a small world",47,"Navigation in a small world","The small-world phenomenon — the principle that most of us are linked by short chains of acquaintances — was first investigated as a question in sociology1, 2 and is a feature of a range of networks arising in nature and technology3, 4, 5. Experimental study of the phenomenon1 revealed that it has two fundamental components: first, such short chains are ubiquitous, and second, individuals operating with purely local information are very adept at finding these chains. The first issue has been analysed2, 3, 4, and here I investigate the second by modelling how individuals can find short chains in a large social network."
6,"random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions and their applications",48,"Random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions and their applications.","Recent work on the structure of social networks and the internet has focussed attention on graphs with distributions of vertex degree that are significantly different from the Poisson degree distributions that have been widely studied in the past. In this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph."
7,"artificial gene networks for objective comparison of analysis algorithms",49,"Artificial gene networks for objective comparison of analysis  algorithms","Motivation: Large-scale gene expression profiling generates data sets that are rich in observed features but poor in numbers of observations. The analysis of such data sets is a challenge that has been object of vigorous research. The algorithms in use for this purpose have been poorly documented and rarely compared objectively, posing a problem of uncertainty about the outcomes of the analyses. One way to objectively test such analysis algorithms is to apply them on computational gene network models for which the mechanisms are completely know.  Results: We present a system that generates random artificial   gene networks according to well-defined topological and kinetic   properties. These are used to run in silico experiments simulating   real laboratory microarray experiments. Noise with controlled   properties is added to the simulation results several times   emulating measurement replicates, before expression ratios are calculated.  Availability: The data sets and kinetic models described here are available from http://www.vbi.vt.edu/~mendes/AGN/as  biochemical dynamic models in SBML and Gepasi formats.

8,"the segment polarity network is a robust developmental module",50,"The segment polarity network is a robust developmental module","All insects possess homologous segments, but segment specification differs radically among insect orders. {I}n {D}rosophila, maternal morphogens control the patterned activation of gap genes, which encode transcriptional regulators that shape the patterned expression of pair-rule genes. {T}his patterning cascade takes place before cellularization. {P}air-rule gene products subsequently 'imprint' segment polarity genes with reiterated patterns, thus defining the primordial segments. {T}his mechanism must be greatly modified in insect groups in which many segments emerge only after cellularization. {I}n beetles and parasitic wasps, for instance, pair-rule homologues are expressed in patterns consistent with roles during segmentation, but these patterns emerge within cellular fields. {I}n contrast, although in locusts pair-rule homologues may not control segmentation, some segment polarity genes and their interactions are conserved. {P}erhaps segmentation is modular, with each module autonomously expressing a characteristic intrinsic behaviour in response to transient stimuli. {I}f so, evolution could rearrange inputs to modules without changing their intrinsic behaviours. {H}ere we suggest, using computer simulations, that the {D}rosophila segment polarity genes constitute such a module, and that this module is resistant to variations in the kinetic constants that govern its behaviour."
9,"the evolutionary origin of complex features",52,"The evolutionary origin of complex features.","A long-standing challenge to evolutionary theory has been whether it can explain the origin of complex organismal features. {W}e examined this issue using digital organisms--computer programs that self-replicate, mutate, compete and evolve. {P}opulations of digital organisms often evolved the ability to perform complex logic functions requiring the coordinated execution of many genomic instructions. {C}omplex functions evolved by building on simpler functions that had evolved earlier, provided that these were also selectively favoured. {H}owever, no particular intermediate stage was essential for evolving complex functions. {T}he first genotypes able to perform complex functions differed from their non-performing parents by only one or two mutations, but differed from the ancestor by many mutations that were also crucial to the new functions. {I}n some cases, mutations that were deleterious when they appeared served as stepping-stones in the evolution of complex features. {T}hese findings show how complex functions can originate by random mutation and natural selection."
10,"early language acquisition cracking the speech code",60,"Early language acquisition: cracking the speech code.","Infants learn language with remarkable speed, but how they do it remains a mystery. New data show that infants use computational strategies to detect the statistical and prosodic patterns in language input, and that this leads to the discovery of phonemes and words. Social interaction with another human being affects speech learning in a way that resembles communicative learning in songbirds. The brain's commitment to the statistical and prosodic patterns that are experienced early in life might help to explain the long-standing puzzle of why infants are better language learners than adults. Successful learning by infants, as well as constraints on that learning, are changing theories of language acquisition."
11,"organization development and function of complex brain networks",61,"Organization, development and function of complex brain networks"," Recent research has revealed general principles in the structural and functional organization of complex networks which are shared by various natural, social and technological systems. This review examines these principles as applied to the organization, development and function of complex brain networks. Specifically, we examine the structural properties of large-scale anatomical and functional brain networks and discuss how they might arise in the course of network growth and rewiring. Moreover, we examine the relationship between the structural substrate of neuroanatomy and more dynamic functional and effective connectivity patterns that underlie human cognition. We suggest that network analysis offers new fundamental insights into global and integrative aspects of brain function, including the origin of flexible and coherent cognitive states within the neural architecture."
12,"motifs in brain networks",62,"Motifs in brain networks.","Complex brains have evolved a highly efficient network architecture whose structural connectivity is capable of generating a large repertoire of functional states. We detect characteristic network building blocks ( structural and functional motifs) in neuroanatomical data sets and identify a small set of structural motifs that occur in significantly increased numbers. Our analysis suggests the hypothesis that brain networks maximize both the number and the diversity of functional motifs, while the repertoire of structural motifs remains small. Using functional motif number as a cost function in an optimization algorithm, we obtain network topologies that resemble real brain networks across a broad spectrum of structural measures, including small-world attributes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that highly evolved neural architectures are organized to maximize functional repertoires and to support highly efficient integration of information."
13,"diffusion on complex networks a way to probe their large scale topological structures",97,"Diffusion on Complex Networks : A way to probe their large scale topological structures","A diffusion process on complex networks is introduced in order to uncover their large scale topological structures. This is achieved by focusing on the slowest decaying diffusive modes of the network. The proposed procedure is applied to real-world networks like a friendship network of known modular structure, and an Internet routing network. For the friendship network, its known structure is well reproduced. In case of the Internet, where the structure is far less well-known, one indeed finds a modular structure, and modules can roughly be associated with individual countries. Quantitatively the modular structure of the Internet manifests itself in an approximately 10 times larger participation ratio of its slowest decaying modes as compared to the null model -- a random scale-free network. The extreme edges of the Internet are found to correspond to Russian and US military sites."
14,"topological generalizations of network motifs",98,"Topological Generalizations of network motifs","Biological and technological networks contain patterns, termed network motifs, which occur far more often than in randomized networks. {N}etwork motifs were suggested to be elementary building blocks that carry out key functions in the network. {I}t is of interest to understand how network motifs combine to form larger structures. {T}o address this, we present a systematic approach to define ""motif generalizations"": families of motifs of different sizes that share a common architectural theme. {T}o define motif generalizations, we first define ""roles"" in a subgraph according to structural equivalence. {F}or example, the feedforward loop triad--a motif in transcription, neuronal, and some electronic networks--has three roles: an input node, an output node, and an internal node. {T}he roles are used to define possible generalizations of the motif. {T}he feedforward loop can have three simple generalizations, based on replicating each of the three roles and their connections. {W}e present algorithms for efficiently detecting motif generalizations. {W}e find that the transcription networks of bacteria and yeast display only one of the three generalizations, the multi-output feedforward generalization. {I}n contrast, the neuronal network of {C}. elegans mainly displays the multi-input generalization. {F}orward-logic electronic circuits display a multi-input, multi-output hybrid. {T}hus, networks which share a common motif can have very different generalizations of that motif. {U}sing mathematical modeling, we describe the information processing functions of the different motif generalizations in transcription, neuronal, and electronic networks."
